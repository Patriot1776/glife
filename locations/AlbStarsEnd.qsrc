'You are walking down the street and see Albina Barlovskuyu standing at the crosswalk. A van screeches to a halt beside her. Uniformed State Security Force personnel jump out of the vehicle and swarm her. They restrain her by forcing her to the ground with her hands behind her back before putting her in handcuffs. Albina is furious, but her face suddenly pales when she sees the warrant for her arrest and hears the accusations of running a human trafficking and prostitution ring. After a thorough search, she is pulled to her feet then forcibly shoved into the back seat of the waiting Security Services car and whisked away.'
